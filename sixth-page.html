            I'm going back to 505<br>
            If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
            In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
            With your hands between your thighs<br><br><br>

            Stop and wait a sec<br>
            When you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?<br>
            I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck<br>
            Or I did last time I checked<br><br><br>

            Not shy of a spark<br>
            The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark<br>
            Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark<br>
            The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start<br><br><br>

            I'm going back to 505<br>
            If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
            In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
            With your hands between your thighs<br><br><br>

            But I crumble completely when you cry<br>
            It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye<br>
            I'm always just about to go and spoil the surprise<br>
            Take my hands off of your eyes too soon<br><br><br>
            
            I'm going back to 505<br>
            If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive<br>
            In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side<br>
            With your hands between your thighs and a smile<br><br><br>
